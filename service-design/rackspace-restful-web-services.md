# Rackspace RESTful Web Services

# REST Overview

## Architectural Properties

-   Performance - component interactions can be the dominant factor in user-perceived performance and network efficiency.
-   Scalability to support large numbers of components and interactions among components
-   Simplicity of interfaces
-   Modifiability of components to meet changing needs (even while the application is running)
-   Visibility of communication between components by service agents
-   Portability of components by moving program code with the data
-   Reliability is the resistance to failure at the system level in the presence of partial failures within components, connectors, or data

## Architectural Constraints

-   Client-Server
-   Stateless
-   Cacheable
-   Layered System
-   Code on Demand (optional)
-   Uniform Interface
    -   Identification of Resources
    -   Manipulation of Resources Through These Representations
    -   Self-Descriptive Messages
    -   Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State
