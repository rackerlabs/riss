# Rackspace Internal Service Standards

## Mission Statement

To provide quality solutions to common technical tasks via cookbooks in the context of guidelines and current best practices.

## Preamble

The goal of this project is to provide a useful resource for developers and solution architects in construction of application programming interfaces for use at Rackspace. Additionally, guidelines and, where appropriate, consistency standards are provided in order to provide a more uniform environment across the company, which is hoped to facilitate interoperability between teams.

### Taxonomy

The following kinds of artifacts are in-scope for this project:

#### Cookbook Recipes

A cookbook recipe is a document focused on describing a common pattern (need or problem) and recommended solution(s) for the common pattern.

Recipes describe best practices for supporting standards and guidelines.

#### Guidelines

A guideline is a piece of advice that may be objective or subjective but should be followed unless there is good reason not to.

#### Standards

A standard is a specific rule that can be objectively satisfied and implemented. A standard should always be implemented by services.  A standard should not be abstract, but should be specific enough that it can be verified by a machine.
